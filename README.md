Regular expressions or RegEx is a sequence of characters mainly used to find or replace patterns embedded in the text. Let’s consider this example: Suppose we have a list of friends-

Regular Expressions example

And if we want to select only those names on this list which match the certain pattern such as something the like this-

Regular Expressions SU

The names having the first two letters- S and U, followed by only three positions that can be taken up by any letter. What do you think, which names fit this criterion? Let’s go one by one, the name Sunil and Sumit fit this criterion as they have S and U in the beginning and three more letters after that. While rest of the three names are not following the given criteria as Ankit is starting with the alphabet A whereas Surjeet and Surabhi have more than three characters post S and U.

A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp; also referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.
